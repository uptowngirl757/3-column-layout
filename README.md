## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SCSS

### What I learned

Whew ðŸ˜¥ I just learned the hard way to always remember to compile my SCSS. I forgot, and it caused so many issuesâ€”my code wasnâ€™t even being compiled! Honestly, Iâ€™m just glad I still remember how to write HTML at all. I had to take a month-long break because of my year 2 college exams, so Iâ€™m actually proud I still remember how to turn on my PC!

### Continued development

I need to further study the `flex` property.

### Useful resources

- [The wesbos flexbox course](https://courses.wesbos.com/account/access/67ec48e105585f952acd8b4f/view/195969223) - The videos on the `flex`, `flex-shrink` and `flex-grow` helped me figure this out.
